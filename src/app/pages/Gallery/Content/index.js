        Ferro Alloys are primarily used in steel making as a deoxidant and alloying agent. The mammoth hike in Steel metallurgy has perhaps been the greatest factor in contributing towards the rapid strides our civilization has taken in the last century. 

        It has now been widely accepted by the Steel Industries and the Government of India that Ferro Alloys do and would continue to play a key and definitive role in scaling up steel production to 300 mtpa by 2030 and therefore, in the development of the country on a broader front.

        <h5>WE ARE CARBON NEUTRAL AND FUTURE POSITIVE</h5>

        So we decided to ditch the power-intensive, electric-arc furnace, in favour of the <b>aluminothermic process of reduction that has negligible carbon footprint. Because we care about a sustainable and eco-friendly future.</b> Besides, this has helped us combat problems of inefficient generation and distribution of power, thereby reducing our cost of production, and helping us retain our competitive advantage over time.
